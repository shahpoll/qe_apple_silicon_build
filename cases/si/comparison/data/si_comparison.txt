# Manual vs PWTK silicon comparison
Manual base: cases/si/manual
PWTK base  : cases/si/pwtk
Max |band difference| : 7.000e-04 eV
Max |DOS difference|  : 5.626e+00 states/eV
Max |PDOS s diff|     : 1.107e+00 states/eV
Max |PDOS p diff|     : 1.153e+00 states/eV
Note: runtime/efficiency metrics not captured in current logs.
Note: DOS traces differ by a constant scale factor (median manual/pwtk ≈ 1.20); shapes overlap after normalisation.
